I have uploaded my resume. Please analyze all its sections and automatically create a creative, modern, and responsive portfolio website for me. The website should showcase my education, experience, projects, technical skills, achievements, and extracurricular activities in an engaging and organized way.

**Portfolio Website Requirements:**

- Use all relevant details from my resume to populate the following sections:
  - Home: My name, a brief intro, and a profile picture placeholder.
  - About: A concise personal bio, academic history, and highlights.
  - Projects: Feature my key projects and research, with titles and descriptions.
  - Experience: Internships, workshops, and key professional experiences.
  - Skills: List technical and programming skills.
  - Achievements: Awards, certifications, and special recognitions.
  - Leadership & Activities: Societies, committees, and leadership roles.
  - Contact: Section with a contact form (name, email, message), and links to my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
  - Resume: Button to download my resume as a PDF.
- The design must be visually appealing, responsive (look great on mobile and desktop), and easy to navigate.
- Organize content to highlight my strengths and unique experiences.
- Add icons or creative touches appropriate for a tech and engineering portfolio.
- Use placeholders for profile and project images
- (Optional): Suggest or generate sample color schemes and font pairings suitable for a modern portfolio.

**Technical requirements and note:**

- The content (headings, project cards, contact form, etc.) must be auto-filled from the uploaded resumeâ€™s details without me re-entering them.
- Generate the full codebase using the MERN stack (MongoDB for form submissions, Express.js/Node.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend), or generate clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if the code should be framework-agnostic.
- Organize your output into clear file/folder sections.

**The goal:**  
Build a unique, creative, and professional personal portfolio website that stands out for job and internship applications, starting from just the information in my resume.
